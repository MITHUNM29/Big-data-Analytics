 Crop Prediction using Data Analytics
This project focuses on utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crop based on soil and climatic conditions. With the growing importance of precision agriculture, the goal is to support farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions that can optimize crop yield and land usage.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains 2,200 records and includes the following features:

Soil nutrient levels: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)

Environmental conditions: Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Rainfall (mm), and pH level

Target variable: Crop label

The dataset is clean, with no missing values, making it ideal for analysis and modeling.

Methodology
The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships among features. Visualizations such as histograms, correlation heatmaps, and feature comparisons are used to identify trends and insights.

Next, K-Means clustering is applied to group similar crops based on growing conditions. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method.

For prediction, the dataset is split into training and testing sets (80:20), and a Logistic Regression model is trained. The model’s performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Finally, the trained model is used to predict the best-suited crop for given conditions, showcasing the practical application of the model.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science can be effectively applied in agriculture to aid in crop recommendation and resource optimization. By integrating data analytics into farming, we can move toward more sustainable and data-driven agricultural practices.
